## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Avoid `any` types wherever possible. Use proper interfaces.
- Use `const` by default; `let` only when reassignment is needed.

### React / Next.js
- Use functional components with hooks.
- Keep components focused — one component per file.
- Place reusable components in `/components`.
- Place page-specific logic in `/app/<route>/page.tsx`.

### Styling
- Use **Tailwind CSS** exclusively (match the existing dark theme).
- Follow the existing color palette: slate-950 backgrounds, blue-500/600 accents.
- Maintain glassmorphism patterns (backdrop-blur, border-white/10).

### File Organization
- API routes: `/app/api/<feature>/route.ts`
- Components: `/components/<ComponentName>.tsx`
- Shared utilities: `/lib/<utility>.ts`
- Database schema: `/configs/schema.ts`
